### 🧠 About Me

I'm an AI/ML Engineer and a current Master’s student at Florida State University. I specialize in deploying **LLM-powered GenAI applications**, optimizing **AI infrastructure on the cloud**, and enabling **production-ready machine learning workflows**. My passion lies in transforming models from research to real-world, reliable, scalable systems.

- 🔬 Currently building multi-agent LLM systems at **IM Digital**  
- 🧰 3+ years of hands-on cloud + AI experience (GCP, AWS, Vertex AI, LangChain, Kubeflow)
- 🏆 Google Cloud Certified – **7x Professional Tracks**
- 💡 Actively working on **RAG**, **CrewAI**, **Gemini**, **FAISS**, **MCP** and **MLOps pipelines**
